# History of the PostgreSQL Name

"Post-gres-Q-L", "Post-grey-sequel", "Postgres"... how do you say it? And where
did the name come from?

PostgreSQL was originally named POSTGRES-- all caps. The name was chosen
because it was the successor to the _Ingres_ database developed at UC
Berkeley.

As the system adopted SQL standards and features, the name was changed to
PostgreSQL. From the docs:

> Many people continue to refer to PostgreSQL as "Postgres" (now rarely in all
> capital letters) because of tradition or because it is easier to pronounce.
> This usage is widely accepted as a nickname or alias.
