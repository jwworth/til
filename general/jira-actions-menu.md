# Jira Actions Menu

Jira has a hidden ticket 'Actions menu' that is really helpful.

When a Jira ticket is in focus, type `.`.

This opens a searchable menu with 'Issue actions' ('Attach', 'Link Issue',
etc.) and 'Workflow' state advancements ('To Do', 'Close', etc.). Almost any
action you'd want to take on a ticket is there.
