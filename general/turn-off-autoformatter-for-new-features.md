# Turn off Autoformatter for New Features

When developing a new feature in a brownfield app that hasn't been subject to
consistent autoformatter treatment, turn off your autoformatter.

Autoformatting is great. I advocate for it. But it can be distracting when
trying to read through your new work. The hard-won changes you make get lost in
the mix of automated changes. Once you've got the feature working, turn on the
autoformatter and get that automatic quality.

This is a pretty niche piece of advice, but it helped me today.
