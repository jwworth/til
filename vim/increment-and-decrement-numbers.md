# Increment and Decrement Numbers

Vim has commands built-in to increment and decrement numbers: `CTRL-A` and `CTRL-X`, respectively.

Combining this with a macro was a technique we tried today to build a large database migration. We ended up finding a more efficient solution, but it's still a very magical key combination.

Check out `:help CTRL-A` for more info.
