# Explore Buffers with BufExplorer

I'm a huge fan of Vim buffers. I try to have my buffer list roughly mirror the files I am currently holding in my brain.

The BufExplorer Vim plugin helps, and is included in the Hashrocket Dotmatrix. Today I learned to use the command `\bs`, which opens a colorful buffer list that you can navigate with Vim directions.
