Anytime you add a header to a markdown file, Github attaches an `href` with its downcased name. 'JavaScript'  receives a link to `#javascript`, for instance.

Leverage this by adding a table of contents to your README with links to the headers further down the document:

```markdown
### Table of Contents

- [Cucumber](#cucumber)
```

This will link to a header containing 'Cucumber'.
