# Read Zsh Built-in Manual Pages

Note: This applies to Zsh, but the process would be similar for any terminal.

In Zsh, if you type `man cd`, instead of a manual page you get an output containing this:

```
See the built-in command description in the appropriate shell manual page.
```

What's going on here? Here's a summary:

> Builtin commands are contained within the shell itself. When the name of a
builtin command is used as the first word of a simple command (see Simple
Commands), the shell executes the command directly, without invoking another
program. Builtin commands are necessary to implement functionality impossible
or inconvenient to obtain with separate utilities. â€“"Shell Builtin Commands", https://www.gnu.org/

To see Zsh's `cd`, we need to view Zsh's built-in man page. `man zsh` lists all
of its man pages and there you'll find `zshbuiltins`, which you can view:

```
man zshbuiltins
```

Zsh's `cd` is described in this document.
