# Autojump and Open

I love [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump). I use it because I think
that remembering my location in a directory structure relative to other
directories, so I can navigate with `cd`, is mental energy I could be using for
something else.

Today I learned that autojump has a `jo` command, which _jumps_ to a directory
and _opens_ it in your file explorer.

```
jo Desktop
```

This might be a throwaway lesson if I wasn't regularly sidetracked by the MacOS
file explorer. Finding a file using the file explorer is a routine operation I
have yet to do fluidly on a Mac. This helps!
