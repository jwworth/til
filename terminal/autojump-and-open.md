# Autojump and Open

I love [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump)-- knowing your location in
a directory structure relative to other directories, so you can 'walk' around
with `cd`, is for the birds.

Today I learned that autojump has a `jo` command, which _jumps_ to a directory
and _opens_ it in your file explorer.

```
jo Desktop
```

This might be a throwaway lesson if I wasn't so regularly frustrated by the
MacOS file explorer. Finding a file using the file explorer is a routine
computer operation I have yet to do fluidly on a Mac. This helps.
