# Directional Commands

You can move the cursor without arrow keys. Here is the keyboard equivalent for each.

* Up ('previous'): `CTRL + P`
* Down ('next'): `CTRL + N`
* Left ('back'): `CTRL + B`
* Right ('forward'): `CTRL + F`

Mapping `caps lock` to `CTRL` makes these combinations very accessible.
