# Save Size Change to iTerm Profile

The longer I program (ahem), the bigger I want my terminal fonts. I think most
programmers should be using a bigger font than they are. Complicating matters,
the standard font for iTerm is miniscule on a computer monitor.

Today I discovered iTerm's 'View > Size Changes Update Profile' feature. When
enabled, changes to your font size via `⌘ +` and `⌘ -` will be applied to your
iTerm profile. The next time you open iTerm, the new font size will persist.
