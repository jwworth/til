# Screen Flashing in OSX

I like a quiet computer. But I also like tab-completing commands in the terminal, which produces a necessary alert from time to time.

A solution I found today is to use OSX Accessibility features to add a screen flash on alerts, then disable the sounds.

System Preferences > Accessibility > Hearing menu, choose 'Audio' > Check 'Flash the screen when an alert occurs'
