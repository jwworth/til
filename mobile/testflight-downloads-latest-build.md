# TestFlight Downloads Latest Build

When you push an iOS build to TestFlight, what's the experience for your
testers? Do they need to opt-in to test the latest build?

Speaking anecdotally as person who has pushed a build and plans to test it
today, when you add that build to your test group, it is automatically
downloaded as the default for each of your testers, replacing the previous
build. You can visit the TestFlight app on your phone to see the apps you can
test. The latest build (build number, an integer, not the SemVer version)
should be automatically downloaded to your device.
