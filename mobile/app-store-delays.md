# App Store Delays

No code here, just an observation from a month of developing for iOS. There can
be a delay on any action taken in the App Store Connect console. Upload a
build, add compliance, add testers: sometimes the result of your choices aren't
reflected in the App Store Connect console for minutes, up to hours.

Patience. Instead of rebuilding or rage-clicking, just wait a reasonable amount
of time for the processes to complete.
