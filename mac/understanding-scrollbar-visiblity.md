# Understanding Scrollbar Visibility

When doing web programming an context where scroll might be expected, you may
see some surprising behavior in the scrollable HTML: an inexplicable gray bar
on the bottom or right (or both) of the element. One culprit, on Mac, is the
scrollbar setting.

On Mac, you can set your OS to always show or sometimes show scrollbars when
they are present. This might aid in your accessibility or user experience. And
if you aren't aware of it, it can also make scrollable elements look weird.

Under "Settings > Appearance > Show scroll bars" you can adjust this setting.
