# Zoom and Scroll in Figma

When viewing a Figma design file, you can zoom in with `CMD` and up or down on
a trackpad or magic mouse.

Scroll with one-finger swipe, left or right.

Zoom and scroll; along with adding comments and copying CSS, that's most of
what I do in Figma.

I'm sure that these commands are useful in many other settings, but I find them especially valuable
in a Figma file, which can feel other challenging for me to navigate.
