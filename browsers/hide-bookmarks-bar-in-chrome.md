# Hide Bookmarks Bar in Chrome

Do you use bookmarks in Chrome, and also take a lot of browser screenshots? If
so, read on.

I don't like including my Chrome bookmarks in browser screenshots; they are
irrelevant and personal. Today I learned that the `CMD + SHIFT + B` hotkey
toggles hiding/showing the Chrome browser bookmarks bar. My workflow is toggle
off the bookmarks, take a clean browser screenshot with `CMD + SHIFT + 4`,
`SPACE`, `ENTER`, and then toggle them back on.
