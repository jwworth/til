### Open Every Site in a Chrome Bookmarks Folder With One Click

When you command-click on a Chrome bookmarks folder, it opens every link in the
folder in a new tab.

I did this by accident; so what's the use case? I use bookmark folders to
categorize my 'work links': hosting, error monitoring, Git hosting, online
docs, etc. With this TIL, I could use this folder to open a new Chrome session
and instantly load it with all the pages I need to be effective.
