# Autofocus a Form Field

`autofocus` is a global attribute that sets a field as focused on page load.

```html
<input name="first_name" autofocus />
```

No JavaScript required!

A use case could be a new customer form that an employee fills out multiple
times a day. By autofocusing the first name field, you could save that
employee thousands of clicks.

Carefully consider user experience and accessibility before using this attribute.
