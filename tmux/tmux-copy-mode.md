# Tmux Copy Mode

Last week we encountered a breaking change in our Tmux configuration, and briefly lost the ability to scroll with the mouse. It became an opportunity to re-learn Tmux's copy mode, and liberate ourselves from the mouse a little more.

Enter copy mode with `<prefix> [`. From here, you can navigate with standard Vim commands.

`ctrl-u` moves you a half-page up, perfect for wading through test failure backtraces.
